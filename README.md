# AspectRatiosNearFinder üîç


___Are you tired of device manufacturer's choosing the ever-so unique and 
elegant screen aspect ratio of 195:422?___

## 
__Welcome to AspectRatiosNearFinder, the smugly condescending script that tells device manufacturer's what their device's viewport dimensions *actually* are.__


<p>Written in python, this script takes a list of tuples for the viewport dimensions, compares them to a list of common, simplified aspect ratios, and 
prints what they are closest to. Useful for web development and image asset design.</p>
